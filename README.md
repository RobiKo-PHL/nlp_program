### Motivation
Why are we doing this? 
  We are making these changes to make the app look and perform better. There were several user stories considered when editing the app. 
What use cases does it support? 
  Our making these changes will allow citizens to communicate with each other with a heavily-moderated platform, Disqus. We will also be able to push out information to the users.
What is the expected outcome?
  We expect that more people will find that the app is visually appealing and easier to use than most apps of this type. One big bonus is that users will be able to communicate with voice and text, which was veery important to our "customer."
